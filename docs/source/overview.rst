Workflow Overview
===================================

These documents describe a standardized Nextflow workflow for processing **DIA mass spectrometry
data to quantify peptides and proteins**. The source code for the workflow can be found at:
https://github.com/mriffle/nf-skyline-dia-ms.

Multiple specific workflows may be run with this Nextflow workflow. Note that in all cases, the
workflow can automatically generate requested reports from the Skyline document and can automatically
upload and (optionally) import the Skyline document into PanoramaWeb and ProteomeXchange.

DIA-NN workflow:
===================================
The workflow will quantify peptides and proteins using user-supplied DIA RAW (or mzML) files, FASTA file, and spectral
library (optional). If the user does not specify a spectral library, DIA-NN will be run in "library-free" mode, where
it will create its own library using AI. Finally the workflow will generate a Skyline document using the quantified peptides
and proteins.

EncyclopeDIA workflow:
===================================

This workflow is summarized in the following article:

**Chromatogram libraries improve peptide detection and quantification by data independent acquisition mass spectrometry.**
Searle BC, Pino LK, Egertson JD, Ting YS, Lawrence RT, MacLean BX, Vill√©n J, MacCoss MJ. *Nat Commun.* 2018 Dec 3;9(1):5128.
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30510204/)

The workflow will quantify peptides and proteins using user-supplied DIA RAW (or mzML) files, FASTA file, and spectral
library. If the experimental design includes generation of a chromatogram library using narrow window DIA data, the workflow will
first generate the chromatogram library (Figure 1A) and use that as input to the next phase (Figure 1B) to quantify peptides and
proteins. If the experimental design does not include this, the user-supplied spectral library is used as input for quantifying
peptides and proteins. Finally the workflow will generate a Skyline document using the quantified peptides and proteins.

The workflow is summarized graphically as:

   generation of a chromatogram library that can be fed into part (B) for peptide and
   protein quantification using DIA. If part (A) is not run, a user-supplied spectral library
   or chromatogram library may be used for quantification in part (B).

How to Run
===================
This workflow uses the Nextflow standardized workflow platform. The Nextflow platform emphasizes ease of use, workflow portability,
and containerization of the individual steps. To run this workflow, **you do not need to install any of the software components of
the workflow**. There is no need to worry about installing necessary software libraries, version incompatibilities, or compiling or
installing complex and fickle software.

To run the workflow you need only install Nextflow, which is relatively simple. To run the individual steps of the workflow on your
own computer, you will need to install Docker. After these are installed, you will need to edit the pipeline configuration file to
supply the locations of your data and execute a simple Nextflow command, such as:

.. code-block:: bash

    nextflow run -resume -r main mriffle/nf-skyline-dia-ms -c pipeline.config

The entire workflow will be run automatically, downloading Docker images as necessary, and the results output to
the ``results`` directory. See :doc:`how_to_install` for more details on how to install Nextflow and Docker. See
:doc:`how_to_run` for more details on how to run the workflow. And see :doc:`results` for more details on how to
retrieve the results.


Workflow Components
===================
The workflow is made up of the following software components, each may be run multiple times for different tasks.

*  **PanoramaWeb** (https://panoramaweb.org/home/project-begin.view)

   Users may optionally use WebDAV URLs as locations for input data files in PanoramaWeb. The workflow will automatically download files as necessary.

*  **msconvert** (https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/)

   If users supply RAW files as input, they will be converted to mzML using *msconvert*.

*  **EncyclopeDIA** (http://www.searlelab.org/software/encyclopedia/index.html)

   *EncyclopeDIA* is used in three parts of the pipeline:

      1. If the user supplies a *BLIB* spectral library, *EncyclopeDIA* will be used to convert that to a *DLIB*.
      2. *EncyclopeDIA* is used to search narrow window DIA data and generate a chromatogram library.
      3. *EncyclopeDIA* is used to quantify peptides and proteins.

*  **Skyline** (https://skyline.ms/project/home/begin.view)

   *Skyline* is run to import raw scan data *EncyclopeDIA* results into a Skyline template file.
