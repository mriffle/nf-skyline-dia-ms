===================================
Workflow Parameters
===================================

The workflow parameters should be included in a configuration file, an example
of which can be found at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/nf-skyline-dia-ms/main/resources/pipeline.config

The parameters in this file should be changed to indicate the locations of your data, the
options you'd like to use for the software included in the workflow, and the capabilities and
configuration for the system on which you are running the workflow steps.

The configuration file is roughly organized as:

.. code-block:: groovy

    params {
    ...
    }

    profiles {
    ...
    }

    mail {
    ...
    }

- The ``params`` section includes locations of data and configuration options for a specific run of the workflow.
- The ``profiles`` sections includes parameters that describe the capabilities of the systems that run the steps of the workflow. For example, if running on your local system, this will include things like how many cores and how much RAM may be used by the steps of the workflow. This will not need to be changed for each run of the workflow.
- The ``mail`` section includes configuration options for sending email. This is optional and only necessary if you wish to send emails when the workflow completes. This will not need to be changed for each run of the workflow.

Below is a complete description of all parameters that may be included in these sections.

.. note::

    This workflow can process files stored in **PanoramaWeb**. When specifying directories or file locations, any paths that begin with ``https://`` will be interpreted as being PanoramaWeb locations.

    For example, to process raw files stored in PanoramaWeb, you would have the following in your pipeline.config file:

    .. code-block:: bash

        quant_spectra_dir= 'https://panoramaweb.org/_webdav/path/to/@files/RawFiles/'


    Where, ``https://panoramaweb.org/_webdav/path/to/@files/RawFiles/`` is the WebDav URL of the folder on the Panorama server.

Note: ``panorama_upload`` must be set to ``true`` and ``skip_skyline`` must be set to ``false`` to use this feature.
   * -
     - ``skyline.skyr_file``
     - Path(s) (local file system or Panorama WebDAV) to a ``.skyr`` file, which is a Skyline report template. Any reports specified in the ``.skyr`` file will be run automatically as the last step of the workflow and the results saved in your ``results`` directory and (if requested) uploaded to Panorama. The report template(s) can be a single string, or for multiple ``.skyr`` files can be given as a list of strings.
       For example: ``'/path/to/report.skyr'`` for a single file, or
       ``['/path/to/report_1.skyr', '/path/to/report_2.skyr']`` for multiple files.
   * -
     - ``skyline.template_file``
     - The Skyline template file used to generate the final Skyline file. By default a
       pre-made Skyline template file suitable for EncyclopeDIA or DIA-NN will be used. Specify a file
       location here to use your own template. Note: The filenames in the .zip file must match
       the name of the zip file, itself. E.g., ``my-skyline-template.zip`` must contain ``my-skyline-template.sky``.
   * -
     - ``skyline.protein_parsimony``
     - If ``true``, protein parsimony is performed in Skyline. If ``false`` the protein assignments given by the search engine are used as protein groups. Default is ``false``.

   * -
     - ``skyline.minimize``
     - If ``true``, the size of the final Skyline document is minimized. Chromatograms for isotopic peaks that are not in the document are removed from the ``skyd`` file and a minimal spectral library is generated by removing spectra that are not in the document. Default is ``false``.
   * -
     - ``skyline.use_hardlinks``
     - On systems that allow it, setting this to ``true`` allows the use of cached Skyline workflow steps and may improve performance on subsequent runs. Note: some systems do not allow this, which will result in an error. Default: ``false``.
   * -
     - ``replicate_metadata``
     - Metadata annotations for each ``raw`` or ``mzML`` file. Can be in ``tsv`` or ``csv`` format. See the :ref:`replicate_metadata` section for details of how the file should be formatted. If a metadata file is specified it will be used to add annotations to the final Skyline document and can be used to color PCA plots in the QC report by specifying the ``qc_report.color_vars`` parameter. If this parameter is set to ``null`` the skyline document annotation step is skipped.
   * -
     - ``qc_report.skip``
     - If set to ``true``, will skip the creation of a the QC report. Default: ``true``.
   * -
     - ``qc_report.normalization_method``
     - Normalization method to use for plots in QC report. Available options are ``DirectLFQ`` and ``median``.
       Default is ``median``

     - List of protein names in Skyline document to plot retention times for.

       For example: ``['iRT', 'sp|P00924|ENO1_YEAST']``

       If ``null``, the standard protein retention time plot is skipped. Default is ``null``
   * -
     - ``qc_report.color_vars``
     - List of metadata variables to color PCA plots by.

       For example: ``['sample_type', 'strain']``

       If ``null``, only a single PCA plot colored by file acquisition order is generated. Default is ``null``
   * -
     - ``qc_report.export_tables``
     - Export tsv files containing normalized precursor and protein quantities? Default is ``false``
   * -
     - ``email``
     - The email address to which a notification should be sent upon workflow completion. If no email is specified, no email will be sent. To send email, you must configure mail server settings (see below).


.. _replicate_metadata:

Providing replicate metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``replicate_metadata`` file can be a ``tsv`` or ``csv`` file where the first column has the header ``Replicate``. The values under the replicate column should match exactly the names of the mzML or raw files which will be in the Skyline document. The headers of subsequent columns are the names of each metadata variable and the values in each column are the annotations corresponding to each replicate.

The ``profiles`` Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The example configuration file includes this ``profiles`` section:

.. code-block:: groovy

    profiles {

        // "standard" is the profile used when the steps of the workflow are run
        // locally on your computer. These parameters should be changed to match
        // your system resources (that you are willing to devote to running
        // workflow jobs).
        standard {
            params.max_memory = '8.GB'
            params.max_cpus = 4
            params.max_time = '240.h'

            params.mzml_cache_directory = '/data/mass_spec/nextflow/nf-skyline-dia-ms/mzml_cache'
            params.panorama_cache_directory = '/data/mass_spec/nextflow/panorama/raw_cache'
        }
    }

These parameters describe the capability of your local computer for running the steps of the workflow. Below is a description of each parameter:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a more advanced and entirely optional set of parameters. When the workflow completes, it can optionally send an email to the address specified above in the ``params`` section.
For this to work, the following parameters must be changed to match the settings of your email server. You may need to contact your IT department to obtain the appropriate settings.

The example configuration file includes this ``mail`` section:

.. code-block:: groovy

    mail {
        from = 'address@host.com'
        smtp.host = 'smtp.host.com'
        smtp.port = 587
        smtp.user = 'smpt_user'
        smtp.password = 'smtp_password'
        smtp.auth = true
        smtp.starttls.enable = true
        smtp.starttls.required = false
        mail.smtp.ssl.protocols = 'TLSv1.2'
    }
