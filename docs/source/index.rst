Skyline DIA Nextflow Documentation
===================================
This workflow is designed to go from RAW files to a Skyline document with search and quantification
results. These results may be optionally uploaded to PanoramaWeb/ProteomeXchange. It makes use of
DIA-NN, EncyclopeDIA, or Cascadia (coming soon) to perform the search.

Please use the links below to navigate to pages describing how to install and run the workflow,
how to retrieve results, and how to set up AWS Batch to run the workflow in the cloud.

Getting Help, Providing Feedback, or Reporting Problems
=======================================================
If you need help, have ideas for new features, encounter a problem, or have any questions or comments, please contact Michael Riffle at mriffle@uw.edu.
